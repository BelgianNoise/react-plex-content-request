# Web Frameworks / Libraries

In this reposity I will strive to create the same website using as many different web frameworks as I can, but mainly focussed on Typescript.

## Website concept

Create a website where people can request new content to be added to my Plex media server.

## Features of the website

These features should be implemented in every version:
 - Routing
 - Global State Management
 - i18n
 - Authentication ( Firebase Auth or equivalent )
 - CR(U)D operations with authorization ( Firebase Firestore (NoSQL document database) or equivalent )

## Status

  - [**React**](https://reactjs.org/):  --->   [gh-pages deployment](https://belgiannoise.github.io/web-frameworks/react/build/#/)
    - [x] Routing (react-router)
    - [x] Global State Management (Redux)
    - [x] i18n (react-i18next)
    - [ ] Authentication ( Firebase Auth )
    - [ ] CR(U)D operations with authorization ( Firebase Firestore )
